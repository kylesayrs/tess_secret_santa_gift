Tufts%20University
"One of the hardest schools to get into in the US, Tufts University had a 14% acceptance rate in 2018. To put that in perspective Harvard is at 6%, Cornell is at 11%, and NYU is at 20%. Arguably a t-20, it&apos;s academic peers are UMich, Emory, Brandeis, and UCLA. The typical student at Tufts took the hardest classes available at their High School, and got a mix of &quot;A&quot;s and &quot;A-&quot;s. Tufts student are fairly affluent (because of the incredibly high tuition), white, quirky, nerdy, and probably jewish. One of the things that sets Tufts apart from other schools is that students at Tufts tend to be all about saving the world, as opposed to making money. students tend to be a little weird, but really nice! Nationwide, Tufts has a reputation for being a school for &quot;Ivy Rejects&quot;. This partially comes from the fact that it&apos;s in a city with Harvard and MIT, and it&apos;s hard to compete with these schools. Although Tufts is many students first choice (it was my first choice, I applied ED!) lot&apos;s of students end up here when they get rejected by their first choice school (usually Brown) and end up here. It&apos;s known for its pre-med program, and is world-renowned for it&apos;s School of International Relations, the Fletcher School. It also has an engineering program that is surprisingly good. If I had to describe Tufts in terms of other schools, I would call it a Northern Emory, Brown but a little easier to get in, and Brandeis but a little harder to get in."

"Shervin is a persian, male, first name. It means Lion from Mazandaran(Northern Iran), King of Lions and describes a man of honour who resembles a lion in his power, energy, rage, hunting behaviour (either hunting women or enemies), and looks (with his long hair). The name is originated in Northern Iran where King Anushiravan ruled. Very characteristic for a person called Shervin is his lion-hearted courage, his sense of honour and pride in his origin. Shervin protects his hunting district and defends it against others who are logically inferior to him, because he is The King. Historically he was a king to whom peoples came to and ask for security. He owned very much power, was feared by his enemies and respected by everyone. In fight-situations Shervin is also called Security at times. These words also describe Shervin very good: someone with- honour, strength, distinction, pride, reputation, prestige, glory."

Shrooms
"Hallucinogenic mushrooms contain psilcybin, psilocin, and baeocystin. Shrooms are incredible and nearly non-toxic too. By incredible I mean it can be the best experience of your life or the worst experience of your life depending on the mood at the time, setting, and who you are with. A good trip can be a learning expeience and lead to extremely thoughtful introspection. A bad trip is as bad as watching your whole family die in a car accident or you can end up being as paranoid as if you were being chased by a guy with a chainsaw in a maze. Seriously, it is incredible. Do not trip right after a bad experience or if you have alot of unpleasant thoughts going through your head at the time. Go into the trip optimistic and usually it will go good, though it is pretty unpredictable. Mild dose effects are colors seem alot more vibrant (blue seeming bluer, black seeming blacker), patterns seem more interesting and intricate, an undescrible feeling of an oncoming mental revelation, giddiness or anxiety. Higher dose effects include extreme laughter, uncontrollable racing thoughts, colors changing and a feeling that each and every color gives a certain tone to your inner most being (hard to explain unless you&apos;ve tried them), distortions of all senses, hyper awareness of taste, smell, music (listen to your favorite band), pictures coming to life and everything becoming three dimensional, or may cause extreme paranoia and/or uncontrollable crying. Also, the beshroomed will have a totally undescribable yet very significant feeling that he/she has attained knowledge that they can not and will not ever lose, just to be a memory the next day. Dosages break down like this: 20-30 grams of wet shrooms is enough to have a good trip. 50 grams is nick-named the &quot;Hero trip&quot;. Dried shrooms is 1/10 the weight of wet shrooms, so 2-3 grams of dried shrooms is a pretty good trip while 5 grams is the &quot;Hero trip&quot;. Anything more and your in for a crazy time.

You&apos;re on a journey w/ a woman who is the most demanding, amazing, frustrating, loving, stubborn, adorable variety of all! Love &amp; passion never die as a partner &amp; they are always at 110%. A fantastic friend, lover, mother, &amp; accomplice. Survive the judgements &amp; hang-trums, &amp; you have someone who&apos;ll be loyally yours to the end (or until you&apos;re kicked to curb). Tips for bringing a Brandy into your life: - They ALL suffer from a terrible disease known as EDL (Excessive Drama Leakage) so there are always little drama puddles nearby. Drama sacs are invisible so a petite Brandy seems like minimal space req&apos;d but the sacs auto-expand to at least 85% of the avail. area. - Love can be bought w/ home BBQ - Food ends ANY argument - If dogs or videos &amp; pictures of dogs, or any other &quot;Awww&quot; animal content is near, you DO NOT have her attention"

"Gin is an unaged liquor made by distilling grains such as barley, corn or rye. Its bouquet comes from juniper berries, coriander, herbs and spices, usually added to the grain mash during distillation. The gin is stored in glass, earthenware or stainless steel containers, but does not mature in these. The storage time serves only to harmonize the product. Someone once said that &quot;A bar without gin is like an Italian kitchen without pasta&quot;. No other liquor provides for the creation of so many classic cocktails. Gin is in fact a liquor that is harmonious with almost anything. Without gin the king of cocktails, the dry Martini, would not exist. "

If other fruit juices or puree&apos;s (such as strawberries or blueberries) it&apos;s called Melomel. If malts, grains and/or hops are added to a mixture of mostly honey and water, it&apos;s called Braggot. If apple juice is added before fermentation, it&apos;s Cyser. If herbs or spices are added it&apos;s Metheglin. Mead predates all known forms of alcohol. Originally it was made with honey, water and wild yeasts, but nowadays it&apos;s usually made with cultured yeast strains. The term honeymoon comes from the practice of drinking mead for the first month after a marriage."

The distillate must age for at least three years and one day in Scotland to be called Scotch whisky, although most single malts are offered at a minimum of eight years of age. Scotch whisky is divided into five distinct categories: single malt, blended malt , blended Scotch whisky, blended grain Scotch whisky, and single grain Scotch whisky. Plain caramel colouring may be added. That is the greatest liquor I have ever drunk so far! I cannot imagine what the world would be without whisky."
